Practice 1: 
Generate two models: 
	"Product": "ID", "Name", "CategoryID" (FK to Category)
	"Category": "ID", "Name"

Practice 2:
Generate a context called "ProductInfoContext"
	Example: https://github.com/TECHCareers-by-Manpower/4.2-MVC/blob/master/FirstASP/Models/PersonContext.cs
	Foreign keys and seed data are not required.
	Please do, however, collate the string fields.

Practice 3:
Implement the foriegn key between product to category in the models and the context file.
	Example: https://github.com/TECHCareers-by-Manpower/4.2-MVC/tree/master/FirstASP/Models

Practice 4: 
Create a migration called "InitialMigration". Push it to the database. Confirm it in PHPMyAdmin. Add seed data for both tables (2 categories and 5 products total minimum). Add a second (and potentially third) migration, and push those as well.
	-Run "dotnet ef migrations add InitialMigration"
	-Run "dotnet ef database update"
	-Make changes to context (add entity.HasData) and don't forget to save
	-Run "dotnet ef migrations add SeedData"
	-Run "dotnet ef database update"

Practice 5:
Create a scaffolded controller with views for the Category model.
	-Right click on Controllers.
	-Select add Controller.
	-Select MVC Controller with Views, Using Entity Framework.
	-Fill out the options (see Library Day 2 spec for screenshots).
	-Hit OK.
